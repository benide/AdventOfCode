#+title: Advent of Code 2023

To-do:
- day 5 is very ugly.
- day 6 part 2 needs to check if the rounded =i= and =j= are off by one. Not checking worked for this input.
- day 8 part 2 solution worked but I'm not sure that it would be right on more general inputs. I think more cycle detection is needed.
- day 12 part 2, not sure, couldn't do it on the first night on my own. I've looked up later that it requires dynamic programming, so I'll have to learn what that is before I come back to this.
- day 13 was easy but the solution is still ugly. Need to clean it up.
